# Reward points

The rules are defined in the rules.py file


In this case, the greedy approach is used where each rule is applied as many times as possible in the following order:
1. Rule 1
2. 2x Rule 4
3. Rule 2
4. Rule 4
5. 3x Rule 6
5. Rule 3
6. Rule 6
7. Rule 7

Note that rule 5 is not present as it is redundant compared to rule 6.
